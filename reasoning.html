<h4>Reasoning Behind Political Misinforamtion</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, there have been many examples of political deception and mass spread of disinformation on Facebook. Dommett and Power argue "that existing metrics offer little insight into current campaign trends-posing analytical, methodological and normative challenges for academics and electoral regulators alike" (para 1). Meaning that there is no current technique for scholarly, or even electoral, <a href="glossary.html#link4">modulation</a> on Facebook. Since Facebook is a media sharing platform, people can say or do basically whatever they'd like on it; this fact highlights the reasoning for most of the political misinformation that appears on the platform. Individuals can freely express their political opinions on the site, and other individuals may perceive it however they'd like. Whether it is peer-reviewed information or not, it can still be distinguished as factual by a majority of the population. Leonard et al. have alleged the reasoning behind this concept, "Generally, this imbalance refers to an overassessment of individual knowledge, that is, the tendency to overestimate one's own expertise or awareness of particular issues or topics" (183).</p>
<p>Politicians claim Facebook is a cost-effective form of political advertisement, but some journalists question its money-saving abilities. Dommett and Power state, "findings suggest that parties are devoting considerable resources to digital advertising, but it is not yet clear which specific outlets are receiving these funds." (para 14). Politicians can manipulate political data on Facebook in a manner that they could not achieve on television with live newscasting. Dommet and Power claim that public confusion about Facebook's electoral cost-efficiency, and the possibility of politician manipulation, could be the main reasonings behind misinformed audiences on the media site.</p>
<p>Araf Bashar concludes that the reasoning behind most political disinformation, which you will read about in the next section, is the <a href="glossary.html#link5">post-truth era</a> Americans have seemingly entered into. The post-truth era refers to the current political climate, with the post-truth meaning "relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief." (173) because many individuals base their opinions on subjective political knowledge they find on Facebook. Ironically, false news, that sparks a reaction from its audience, spreads rampantly compared to objective fact. This explains how so many people find and follow fabricated political claims so quickly on media platforms like Facebook.</p>
<p>The myriad of differentiated personal perceptions is another lead rationality behind the popularization of the false political data on Facebook. So many people have so many different opinions about certain political subjects, because of this everybody perceives these topics differently. For instance, have you ever played the <a href="https://icebreakerideas.com/telephone-game/">Telephone Game</a><table border="0px" width="190px" align="right">
<tr><td><img src="telephone.png" width="200px" height="160px" alt="Telephone"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><i>Free Clip-art Image</i></td></tr>
</table>? All players stand in a line and the first person in line creates a statement that they will verbally pass down to the rest of the people in line. The objective is to see how different the original statement is from the statement that the last person in line heard. Usually, the last person's statement is wildly different from the original because there are so many contrasting perceptions from the people between the first and last players. That is exactly what happens on social media; political facts and opinions become one big grey area of emotional perceptions.</p>
<p>Social media websites, like Facebook, are organized with algorithms based on relevancy. This not only controls the parameters in which a journalist's writing becomes viral but also what information certain audiences are obtaining. For example, if a person opens up their Facebook feed and sees dozens of political news journals that are falsely modified for viewer entertainment purposes, they are bound to make an emotional connection with one of the journals and perceive it as true because of the source. Facebook's organizational methods play a key role in the spreading of false news; since it's algorithmic cues are organized from most to least interesting instead of most to least factually relevant</p>
