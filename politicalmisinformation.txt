<h4>What is Political Misinformation?</h4>
<p>Fabricated news has been a prevalent aspect of Facebook since the media site was created, especially politically based news postings. <a href="glossary.html#link2">Political misinformation</a> occurs on Facebook when a user, politician, or citizen, share a post containing biased information with the public and a majority of the public distinguish it as fact. For example, Donald Trump has been making accusatory Facebook posts against the election process and Dominion voting software. He even goes as far as claiming election fraud; while posting things such as, "Voter fraud in Detroit is rampant, and has been for many years!" (Trump). These posts hold no evidential proof, but large majorities in certain regions perceive them as true-to-life statements. Meaning, many people are receiving specious information from a "reliable" source and perceiving it as verified content.</p>
<p>The most alarming aspect of political sharing on Facebook is that a lot of its politically-based content is written by journalists that are seeking audience response; while a majority of their audience only derive political knowledge from Facebook and perceive the journalism as peer-reviewed information. This can cause issues during electoral periods because not every voter is receiving valid data about their electoral candidates. However, Facebook is not the only 
platform that allows users to share exaggerated material; television and other social sites such as, Twitter, enable the sharing of political fabrications as well. Researcher Miriam Steiner maintains the belief that, due to the algorithmic order of Facebook content, political 
s have abandoned their ethical writing practices to attract as many users as possible; even if it means bending or falsifying the truth (245). She states, "journalists' content competes with many other types of content on Facebook's marketplace of attention, with the algorithm deciding which items have greater visibility." (Steiner 245).</p> 
<p>Following political agendas, embellished journalism is one of the leading causes of political misinformation on Facebook. Researchers such as Stier et al. insinuate that journalists aren't the only ones fabricating political material for their own gain, but politicians might be dipping their toes in Facebook-related political exaggeration as well. Researchers state, "it is an open question if politicians tailor their online messages to the topic priorities of a mass audience or particular social media audiences" (Stier et al. 53).</p>
