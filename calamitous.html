<h4>Calamitous Effects of Political Misinformation</h4>
<p class="rightpquote">"the illusion of knowing..."</p>
<p>When government officials make questionable allegations on a widely known media sharing platform, like Facebook, it can have detrimental effects on the electoral process and the general population. For instance, when Donald Trump alleged that Detroit's electoral count was inaccurate on Facebook, Michigan was forced to recount the electoral votes by hand. Trump's allegations against the company that created Dominion software has caused company employees to receive death threats from his supporters. When <a href="glossary.html#link3"> erroneous</a> material is posted on Facebook, it can cause an emotional uproar, especially when the mentioned material is posted by the President, or former President, of the United States. Though Trump's statements may be true, the claims are not based on actuality.</p>
<p>Researchers Leonard et al. suspect that another worrisome effect of political misinformation on Facebook is "the illusion of knowledge" (183) that takes place in society. This social confusion can lead to many voters making uninformed decisions during electoral periods. Researchers give insight as to how this imbalance of political data affects our democracy by stating, "Given the importance of political knowledge for the functioning of a democracy, an imbalance between actual and perceived knowledge must be perceived as dysfunctional. Such mismatches require special attention and have thus already been investigated in the past." (183). Signifying that fabricated news and political generalizations could be responsible for invalidating current governmental standings.</p>
