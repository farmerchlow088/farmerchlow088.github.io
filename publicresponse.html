<h4>Public Response to Misinformation</h4>
<p>Responding to misinformation on Facebook can be tricky because usually social fabrications are based around generally important concepts, politics in particular. These concepts become key parts of society and start to affect people emotionally. When misguided postings, like Trump's accusations against <a href="glossary.html#link6">Dominion</a>, reach the public and start having widespread effects, such as making an entire state recount electoral votes by hand, it sparks adverse emotions in people that don't find those accusations fact-based. Researcher Arash Bafar conducted a study on the general cognitive response of false content on Facebook. While doing so, he concluded that people respond anxiously to true political claims, but "Facebook followers' responses to political disinformation are filled with greater anger" (275). Political misinformation on social media platforms enrage the well informed and give false ammunition to the misguided. Unfortunately, this leads to a general divide in public belief and societal associations.</p>
<p class="leftpquote">"The epidemic of information disorder in social media has in part triggered the transition to the post-truth era..."</p>
<p>Political fabrications on Facebook lead to outrage from the majority and, as Leonard et al. claim, decrease the validity of American democracy as a whole. Researcher Bafar believes, "The epidemic of information disorder in social media has in part triggered the transition to the post-truth era." (173), and even goes on to state the three forms of online deception as disinformation, propaganda, and misinformation. Disinformation refers to false information that is created with intent, propaganda refers to allegedly true political content that is packaged in a manner that will rally supporters and discredit opponents, and misinformation is the accidental publication of false information; with political disinformation being the general term for all three of these deception tactics (Bafar 173). Each deceptive ruse derives a different <a href="glossary.html#link7">cognitive response</a> from Facebook users. These differentiated cognitive responses could be anxiety, happiness, sadness, and anger. Since a large number of people are seemingly cultivating most of their political knowledge based on emotional opinion, it leads researchers to believe that the efficiency of our democracy is taking a hit from the fundamental errors occurring in political media sharing.</p>
