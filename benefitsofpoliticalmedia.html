<h4>Benefits of Politically Based Media on Facebook</h4>
<p class="leftpquote">"spending more time on Facebook correlate to a higher engagement level in online political activities..." (429).</p>
<p>Though the mass spread of false political information is a downfall for Facebook, there are still many favorable aspects about its legislative contribution. Woefully, younger generations have lost a sense of political seriousness, but by endorsing politically based content on this media platform, Facebook is enabling more people to gain a fundamental understanding of major political topics. Researchers Ho-Yin Yue et al. explain that Facebook can lead to an increase of political engagement from certain populations by stating, "spending more time on Facebook correlate to a higher engagement level in online political activities." (429).</p>
<p>Another positive political <a href="glossary.html#link10">attribute</a> of Facebook is the ease it has created in the electoral campaigning processes. Some political material is altered but not all of it; aside from the fallacies that take place on the media platform, it is a great way for voters to learn about candidate policies and intentions. Steir et al. name three forms of productive candidate representation on Facebook, and they are listed as "promoting issue positions, demonstrating beneficial personality traits, and improving name recognition." (para 11). By posting their political highlights on Facebook, electoral candidates can appeal to portions of their audience that would be otherwise unattainable, such as younger generations that are not as involved with their political standings. Having a younger generation become aware, and even enthusiastic, about politics is a positive thing for a country. It could mean future politicians, political growth, and constitutional change for the benefit of a country's entire population.</p>
