<h4>Political Growth Due to Facebook</h4>
<p>The political world of Facebook has experienced downfalls, but it has also projected political growth among younger generations. Politics will likely always be important because it dictates the leadership of this country, but if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, did it fall? This is where Facebook becomes beneficial; it decreases the chance of politics becoming obsolete to younger generations because it has allows politics to adapt to the changing media fads. Younger generations seldom partake in cable programs, such as Fox or CNN, thus making Facebook a perfect platform for politicians to reach young minds. Researches Ho-Yin Yue et al. maintain that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney spent quite a bit of money trying to reach the untapped electoral votes of youthful citizens by utilizing Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (427).</p>
<p>Swedish journalist, Lotta Svensson believes that social media sites like Facebook can increase the political involvement of youths in rural areas. She followed certain political groups on Facebook and came to this conclusion "Awareness of the importance of involving young people in development, and the difficulties in mobilizing young people towards traditional party politics, as well as a fascination with the force and relative success of new social movements, contributed significantly to the interest in this Facebook group among municipal politicians and civil servants." (para 11). By coming to this conclusion, she further elaborates why social media platforms like Facebook have become so crucial in certain regions. Facebook, like any media sharing program, can be used for favorable or unfavorable outcomes. It is the people who use the platform that determine its political productivity in society. This signifies that political candidates, journalists, and voters need to be conscious of the actuality that their posts contain if Facebook is to become a reliable source of ministerial data.</p>
<p>Youths are not the only ones who benefit from having political information accessible on Facebook; many adults have gained from it as well.
Since many older people do not have time to participate in the same political events that a young person would, due to their day jobs, they can utilize Facebook to stay in the loop with political points of view. Even if these points of view aren't completely objective, it is still gratifying to have a political outlet at their finger-tips. To back this statement researchers Ho-Yin Yue et al. state that teenagers "have a larger flexibility and availability in joining political activities when comparing with adult Facebook users who may need to skip their fulltime occupation to join the same activities." (427). Making Facebook a perfect place for older generations to connect in online political gatherings, such as; presidential, electoral candidate, and politician Facebook pages.</p>
