<p><h4>Facebook as a Political Knowledge Date Base</h4></p>
<p>In recent years, <a href="glossary.html#link1">Facebook</a> has become a popular platform for spreading mass amounts of political information to specific audiences, but how much of this information is fact-based? This social site is a way for people to share an endless volume of details, including political knowledge.<table border="0px" width="190px" align="right">
<tr><td><img src="facebook.png" width="165px" height="118px" alt="Facebook"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><i>Pixabay Image</i></td></tr></table> The main reasoning behind Facebook's newfound political position is due to its accessibility and alleged cost-reducing abilities; this enables politicians to spread information like wildfire without the hassle or expense of news production teams. Many researchers believe that Facebook is unreliable in this instance because of how much control politicians have over what information gets publicized; other researchers argue that social media is a great way to get younger generations to engage in politics and allow people to share their legislative opinions. The purpose of this research is to determine if Facebook is an effective way for people to share information and educate themselves on political matters.</p>

 <a href="politicalmisinformation.html">Political Misinformation</a>
occurs on Facebook when a user, politician, or citizen, share a post containing biased information with the public and a majority of the public distinguish it as fact.</p>
<p class="block" style="position: relative; top:20px;">
<a href="benefitsofpoliticalmedia.html">Facebook campaigning does create political benefits,</a> though the mass spread of false political information is a downfall for Facebook, there are still many favorable aspects about its legislative contribution. Woefully, younger generations have lost a sense of political seriousness, but by endorsing politically based content on this media platform, Facebook is enabling more people to gain a fundamental understanding of major political topics.</p>

<a href="conclusion.html">Concluding Data-</a> Since the amplification of news is usually based on the emotional standards of users, it has become inherently effortless for the majority of certain populations to become falsely informed.</p>
