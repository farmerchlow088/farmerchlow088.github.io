<h4>Concluding Statement Regaurding the Validity of Facebook's Political Knowledge</h4>
<p>Since Facebook was created, it has become a breeding ground for all types of fallacies, including political ones. Some researchers argue that this mass spread of false news is the very foundation for U.S. democracy's descent into <a href="glossary.html#link8">ambivalence</a>. Users, journalists, and politicians all have free reign over what topics become viral to the population. Since the amplification of news is usually based on the emotional standards of users, it has become inherently effortless for the majority of certain populations to become falsely informed. The sharers of false political data are not the only ones to blame for this mass political imbalance of true and false information, but the structure of Facebook's post-placement system is flawed as well.</p>
<p>With the downfalls listed above in mind, Facebook is not a completely obsolete political sharing method. Facebook acts as a door that enables people to share their political standings, emotions, and agendas to a variety of audiences. This inevitably connects like-minded people, while allowing <a href="https://gsdrc.org/professional-dev/governance-politics-growth/">political growth and understanding</a> for audiences that might not receive it off of Facebook. This social media platform warrants political togetherness, and political division; with the choice being in the eye of the beholder. Without social media platforms, politicians wouldn't be able to easily connect with their audience, get a younger generation excited about politics, or create an online political community amidst a global pandemic.</p>
<p>However, there is room for organizational improvement on this social platform. Journalists can manipulate their writing so it appeals to the standards of Fakebook's <a href="glossary.html#link9">algorithmic makeup</a>. By doing so, they can control which information is well-received by the audience, whether it is objective or not, and which content isn't. Many researchers, including Bashar and Stier at al., believe that Facebook's algorithmic cues are to blame for the inefficiency of political sharing on the site.</p>
<p> In conclusion, Facebook is not a reliable source for factual political data but is a seemingly necessary political sharing platform as it's convenience for users and politicians rises during current economic climates, but this media site is in no way perfect. For Facebook to become an actual political knowledge base, instead of just a source to make political connections, it's algorithmic makeup would have to be modified. The creators of Facebook would have to create a filtration system to divide subjective and objective political knowledge. This would allow users to decide whether they want to debate over political opinion or read peer-reviewed political content. The best visible solution would be to change the algorithmic cues of Facebook to pick up on fact-based content rather than entertainment quality. As well, users need to have less authority over the manipulation of political content that is allowed on Facebook. These two changes would dismantle the foundation for false political media sharing, and allow for Facebook to achieve its reliability as a political source.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly necessary to weed out the false political information on Facebook, while still keeping it as a sharing platform for the subject. If the wrong informative trends stay popularized on the social media site, it could mean the invalidity and dismantling of the U.S. governmental branches; while discrediting politicians in the eye of their viewers. If Facebook ceases to be a platform for political sharing, it could prove detrimental for communications between political candidates and their younger audiences. These downfalls prove that Facebook is necessary for political survival in this technology-obsessed era.</p>
